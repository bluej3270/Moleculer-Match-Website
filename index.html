                        Looking for: I'm not metal so no metallic bond, however an Ionic bond with a metal or a covalent bond with another non metal is possible.

                        Stats: 
                        <br>
                        - I only melt at 3,550 &#8451;
                        <br>
                        - I'm one of the more common elements
                        <br>
                        - Some places you'll find me: most plans and animals on this planet are carbon based. 
                        <br>
                        - I'm part of the air breathed out by many animals and used by many plants.
                        <br>
                        - I'm not a metal, but I am used in the construction of some things. One example of this is in some planes.

                        A metal or non metal, I could gain or lose all 4 of my vallence electrons. One ideal match is oxegen as with 2 oxegen, each with a -2 charge, there will be a perfect ballance of electrons. A non-ideal match would be a metal with a charge of 5, such as Iron (V) as that woule require a large amount of carbon and iron to ballance out and form an ionic bond.

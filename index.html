                        Looking for: I'm not metal so no metallic bond, however an Ionic bond with a metal or a covalent bond with another non metal is possible.

                        - I am located in the 14th column of the periodic table on the second row with a charge of 4
                        - I have 6 protons and 4 valence electrons 
                        - My electronegativity is 2.55
                        - My Ionisation Energy is 1,086.5 kj/mol

                        A metal or non metal, I could gain or lose all 4 of my vallence electrons. One ideal match is oxegen as with 2 oxegen, each with a -2 charge, there will be a perfect ballance of electrons. A non-ideal match would be a metal with a charge of 5, such as Iron (V) as that woule require a large amount of carbon and iron to ballance out and form an ionic bond.
